# EpochsIV
Repository for results of EPOCHS IV paper for community use. Here we tabulate our galaxy stellar mass functions and associated Schechter fits. We also include high-quality PDF copies of key figures. 

Table3_FiducialBagpipesGSMF.ecsv is Table 3 from our paper. It includes the fiducial Bagpipes GSMF in all our redshift bins.

The formatting of the tables is made to be compatible with the FLAGS comparison dataset repository style (https://github.com/stephenmwilkins/flags_data/).
